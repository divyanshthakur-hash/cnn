# Assignment 1.1
# Problem Statement
To Make a simple fully connected network to classify the MNIST dataset.
 # Requirment to Run The code
Google Colab (Other compilers can also be use who support ipynb file. But tensorflow, keras, numpy is to be install on the system.

# Libraries Used

> from keras.datasets import mnist

To import MNIST Dataset from keras
> from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

To generate classification report for getting F-Scores

>from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix 

To genertae confusion matrix

# Structure of Code
> (x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data() 

To load the MNIST data

> print("Training data shape X (training set, pixel, peixel): ", x_train.shape) 

To print training data shape X (60000, 28, 28)

>print("Test data shape X (testing set, pixel, peixel):", x_test.shape)

To print testing data shape X (10000, 28, 28)

> print("Training data shape Y (training set, pixel, peixel): ", y_train.shape) 
 
 To print training data shape y (60000, 28, 28)

> print("Test data shape Y (testing set, pixel, peixel)", y_test.shape) 

To print testing data shape Y (10000, 28, 28)

> rp = np.random.permutation(len(x_train))
  rp[:]

To print a list of numbers with total numbers in training set in random order. this is a function(random.permutation) provided by numpy.

> rp = rp[:10]

> img(x_train[rp], y_train[rp])


To print a random images first i create a function called (img) and assign the values for rows and columns . By the the help of of matplotlib.plt the images will show.

> x_train = x_train.reshape(60000, 784)

To reshape the training set into 1Dimension

> x_test = x_test.reshape(10000, 784)
 
 To reshape the testing set into 1Dimension. same is done with y_train and y_test.

 > x_train = x_train / x_test.max() 

 To convert the minimum pixel value into 0, here x_test.max() is 255.

> x_test = x_test / x_test.max() 
 To convert the maximum pixel value into 1, here x_test.max() is 255.

> from keras.utils import to_categorical    
y_train = to_categorical(y_train, num_classes=10)  
y_test = to_categorical(y_test, num_classes=10)
 
 We are doing multiclsss calssifictaion. we need otuput in a vector of size 10 only the predicted digit will show the value 1 and rest will show 0. For this we use one hot encoding. Keras provides the function to_categorical for classfying into 10 different categories.

 # Model

 > model_input = Input(shape=(784,))
 
Model having input of 784 units.

 > hidden_layer = Dense(units=400, activation="relu")(model_input)

will take the input from model_input output. relu activation function is used. 

 > output_layer = Dense(units=10, activation="sigmoid")(hidden_layer)

will take the input form hidden_layer output. sigmoide activation function is used beacuse we need the result in form of 0 and 1.

> opt = keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)                
model.compile(optimizer=opt, loss="categorical_crossentropy", metrics=["accuracy"])

Adam optimizer is used with learning rate  = 0.01

> history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, batch_size=128, epochs=10, validation_split=0.2)

history function is created and in this fucnction model.fit is used to train the model with batch size=128, and validation split = 0.2. the reason for creating history function is to plot the graph. 

> preds = model.predict(x_test, batch_Size=128)         
preds = preds.argmax(axis-1) to get the predicted number in the form of (0 to 9)
Y_test = Y_test.argmax(axis=1) to return into normal format (0 t0 9).

For predication

> print(classification_report(y_test, preds))     
>  confusion_matrix(y_test, preds)

Used for fscore and confusion matrix.
